## Alarm Flood

Operators in a manufacturing plant are confronted with a steady stream of alarms which are meant to alert them to adverse conditions.  It is up to the operators to use their experience to determine which issues to tackle first.  Sometimes they miss an important alarm which results in downtime and an economic loss from lost production.  It is common that an alarm interface will consist of a large table that dynamically fills with the most recent alarm information.  During times when a process is upset, this table can be continuously updating which can be overwhelming even for experienced operators.

## Dynamic Prioritization of Alarms

Train an algorithm with information about how long it takes to correct a problem signaled by and alarm and the potential consequence of ignoring it.  Use this algorithm to dynamically assess the priorities and present the operator with the most pertinent information.  The algorithm will be trained using our historical alarm log and the records of economic loss resulting from different problems.

I believe that the model will provide greater insight into the process by identifying weak spots.  If alarms associated with a certain piece of equipment are consistently prioritized then it may justify upgrading the equipment to make the process more robust.  The relative prioritization of alarms before and after an equipment change is made could be used as semi-quantitative evidence of its effectiveness.

The end result will be a graphical interface that shows an operator only the 5 most important actions that they need to take ranked by importance.  It will also offer options for the operator to override the predicted importance to provide live feedback.  Rather than a large table of alarms the interface will allow for quick navigation to top 5 issues while also providing some summary bar graphs to illustrate whether the issues are isolated to a single area, or plantwide.  The interface will adapt to the current user to bolster their strengths and compensate for their weaknesses.  For example if a certain operator usually takes more time to resolve an issue with at certain piece of equipment, it will prioritize alarms associated with that equipment to maximize the amount of time that operator has to respond.

There will be several hurdles to developing the model.  There are many biases in the data set, for example, some operators are better than others, and already know which alarms require immediate attention.  This presents a challenge because they will likely prevent economic loss from occurring, which the model may interpret as the alarm being inconsequential.

## Evolution of the Operator Role

I suspect there are groups of alarms clogging up the logs that do not provide the operators actionable information.  Some of these alarms may just need to be routed to different personnel, perhaps maintenance, or management.  Others may not have any value at all and can be discarded.  By routing these alarms to the proper parties it will improve the process for all stakeholders.

With the implementation of Dynamic Alarm Prioritization it will enable operators to focus on the most important tasks, reducing the likelihood of damaging equipment or having to shut down the process because of an operator missed a critical alarm.  Ideally this will also enable them to become more engaged in other activities such as optimization.  Because they are no longer forced to concentrate on the constant alarm stream I foresee their role transforming into a more proactive role.
