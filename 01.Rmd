## Alarm Flood

Operators in a manufacturing plant are confronted with a steady stream of alarms which are meant to alert them to adverse conditions.  It is up to the Operators to use their exerience to determine which issues to tackle first.

## Dynamic Prioritization of Alarms

Train an algorithm with information about how long it takes to correct a problem signalled by and alarm and then the potential consequence of ignoring it.  Use this algorithm to dynamically assing priorities and present the operator with the most pertinant information.

## Evolution of the Operator Role

With the implementation of Dynamic Alarm Prioritization it will enable operators to focus on the most important tasks, reducing the the likelyhood of damaging equipment or having to shut down the process because of an operator missed a critical alarm.  Ideally this will also enable them to become more engaged in other activities such as optimization.
