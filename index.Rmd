### Dynamic Process Alarm Prioritization {-}

The modern process operator in a manufacturing plant is constantly bombarded with alarms generated by the automated control system.

By presenting the operator with a list of only the most critical alarms they can use their time most effectively and prevent costly downtime.

## About the author {-}

I enjoy craft beers, hearing jokes, and drawing.  When I'm not working on cool data projects I'm making silly insect stencils.
