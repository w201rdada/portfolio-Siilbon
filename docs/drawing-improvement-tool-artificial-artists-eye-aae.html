<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> The Creative Struggle</h2>
<p>One of the most fundamental mediums for artistic expression is pencil drawing. It doesn’t require expensive materials or space and it can be used to plan works, or create beautiful original works. Drawing takes a lot of practice and it can be stressful to ask the opinion of others during the early stages of a work. Asking the opinion of other artists invites them to share their valuable experience, but it is often accompanied with their personal biases. Because pencil drawings are monochromatic and have high contrast between the paper and the graphite they can be readily analyzed by a computerized tool. A tool that allows the user to select images to compare against their work empowers the artist. Using the Artificial Artists Eye (AAE) an artist can get feedback without stifling their personal creativity or signature style.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-using-a-machines-suggestions" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Learning using a Machine’s Suggestions</h2>
<p>To help alleviate some of the stress of this process, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to recognize elements of other images and “score” the user artist’s drawing against them. For example, the algorithm could take a group of images of humans and judge the drawing’s body proportions, maybe the forearms are too long, or the torso too short.</p>
<p>The algorithm could also compare the target picture against things like the composition, the line quality, and shape. Several similar methods of analysis have already been developed in the pursuit of making graphics that appear hand drawn.<span class="citation">(Li Zhi-hui et al. <a href="#ref-li_zhi-hui_sketch_2012">2012</a>)</span> <span class="citation">(Ruilin Lin <a href="#ref-ruilin_lin_study_2011">2011</a>)</span> The composition can be judged by the density of graphite throughout zones of the drawing, this way, areas of the drawing can be identified as sparse or busy. Line quality could also be quantified by comparing the relative thickness and uniformity of the lines in the test to the set of drawings used for training. The shapes in the drawing are the 2-D projections of the 3-D subjects, so the outline of the test drawing can be measured against the training set. The degree to which the artist’s angles, whether sharper or softer than the test set, will be indicated. Assessing these core elements of a drawing would be one way for an artist to quantify improvement.</p>
<p>One way for an artist to use this tool would be to improve their representations of real subjects. For example, photos of apples could be used to train the tool. Then the tool would output an evaluation of how “apple-like” the user’s drawing was based on the criteria mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Another way to use the tool is to try to deviate from established rules or norms. Someone focusing on a fantastic or surrealist work may be interested in moving their drawings away from realistic representations. This tool would provide them a way to judge which parts of their work deviates from the test set and the magnitude of the differences. Perhaps the artist notices that their hectic line work sets them apart from the images they used to train the tool, which leads them to experiment further.</p>
</div>
<div id="building-artistic-skills" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Building Artistic Skills</h2>
<p>The tool is meant to help artists explore methods to improve their work without compromising the creative process. Like any tool, it needs to used correctly. The AAE will never replace an artist’s vision, creativity, or judgement, but instead provides the artist with a way to track their progress and find their style. To meet this end, AAE would be implemented with “artist in the loop” design, where the user can interact to influence the performance. An artist will be able to set and adjust a personal stylistic baseline (comprised of the elements mentioned earlier) so their progress is judged against their personal ideal.</p>
<p>The tool is limited by the quality and quantity of training drawings. Therefore, the tool is not well suited to judging an entirely unique or new piece because of the lack of material for comparison. In some cases individual elements of drawing can be judged and the results of multiple analyses can be synthesized for a cumulative result.</p>
<p>Using AAE allows an artist to get rapid personalized feedback on the core elements of their piece while maintaining creative control. The artist then interprets the feedback and innovates further so that the tool <em>supplements</em> the creative process rather than <em>supplanting</em> it. A beginner learning to draw could discover that they need to spend more time practicing fundamentals, while an experienced artist could get a better understanding of what makes their work unique by building a baseline.</p>
