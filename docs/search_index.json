Dynamic Process Alarm Prioritization The modern process operator in a manufacturing plant is constantly bombarded with alarms generated by the automated control system. Since all of the alarms and their outcomes are recorded, a model could be trained to recognize which alarms are the most critical. By presenting the operator with a list of only the most critical alarms they can use their time most effectively and prevent costly downtime.

It is up to the operators to use their experience to determine which issues to tackle first. Sometimes they miss an important alarm which results in downtime and an economic loss from lost production. It is common that an alarm interface will consist of a large table that dynamically fills with the most recent alarm information. During times when a process is upset, this table can be continuously updating which can be overwhelming even for experienced operators. By leveraging the thousands of measurements that are already aggregated in an automated control system it’s possible to alleviate some of the pressure. Currently, the process of alarm management is often implemented using a labor intensive brute force technique involving a large time investment from a multidisciplinary team.(Hollifield 2010) By generating a model which determines what alarms are critical during the current mode of operation, the operators will benefit from their collective experience without the large team performing alarm management analysis. The model will act as a tool, which used in conjunction with human insight, will help reduce lost production by improving the meaningful productivity of operators. 1.2 Dynamic Prioritization of Alarms The solution is to train an algorithm with information about how long it takes to correct a problem signaled by and alarm and the potential consequence of ignoring it. This algorithm will be used to dynamically assess the priorities and present the operator with the most pertinent information. The priority of an alarm increases with the consequence of the failing to take action, and the amount of time to take that action. So, issues resulting in damage to expensive equipment that occur quickly would be used to assign the highest priority. This is possible by reconciling the logs of all the operator actions related to a piece of equipment which occurred between the generation of the equipment alarm and its resolution. The alarms and actions will both be categorized by the associated equipment. The end result will be a graphical interface that shows an operator only the 5-10 most important issues that they need to correct ranked by importance. It will also offer options for the operator to override the predicted importance to provide live feedback. Rather than a large table of alarms the interface will allow for quick navigation to top 5-10 issues while also providing some summary bar graphs to illustrate whether the issues are isolated to a single area, or plantwide(Tufte, n.d.). The interface will adapt to the current user to compensate for their lack of experience. To shorten the onboarding process, a common low experience account would serve as a baseline before it customized to a new employee. One demonstrative example would be a high temperature alarm on a product storage tank. Perhaps a single high temperature alarm may not represent a major threat to the product’s quality. However, if several of the high temperature alarms begin to activate then the model will recognize the important systemic issue with the cooling system and prioritize the group of alarms. There are groups of alarms clogging up the logs that do not provide the operators actionable information. Some of these alarms may just need to be routed to different personnel, perhaps maintenance, or management. Others may not have any value at all and can be discarded. By routing these alarms to the proper parties, it will improve the process for all stakeholders. 1.3 Evolution of the Operator Role There will be several hurdles to developing the model. There are many biases in the data set, for example, some operators are more experienced than others, and already know which alarms require immediate attention. Experienced operators will take action proactively, in some cases even before an alarm is triggered. One possible solution would be to identify when an operator alters the conditions of some equipment in the absence of alarms. This may require manual intervention to determine what adverse conditions were avoided. With the implementation of a Dynamic Process Alarm Prioritization model, operators will divert their attention to the most important tasks. The increase in their meaningful productivity will reduce the likelihood of damaging equipment or halting production because an operator missed a critical alarm. Because they are no longer forced to concentrate on the constant alarm stream they will have time to think proactively resulting in fewer alarms overall. By embedding the experience of all the operators in the model, an estimated week of unplanned downtime could be avoided annually increasing throughput by millions of dollars. References "],

It doesn’t require expensive materials or space and it can be used to plan works, or create beautiful original works. Drawing takes a lot of practice and it can be stressful to ask the opinion of others during the early stages of a work. Asking the opinion of other artists invites them to share their valuable experience, but it is often accompanied with their personal biases. Because pencil drawings are monochromatic and have high contrast between the paper and the graphite they can be readily analyzed by a computerized tool. A tool that allows the user to select images to compare against their work empowers the artist. Using the Artificial Artists Eye (AAE) an artist can get feedback without stifling their personal creativity or signature style. 2.2 Learning using a Machine’s Suggestions To help alleviate some of the stress of this process, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to recognize elements of other images and “score” the user artist’s drawing against them. For example, the algorithm could take a group of images of humans and judge the drawing’s body proportions, maybe the forearms are too long, or the torso too short. The algorithm could also compare the target picture against things like the composition, the line quality, and shape. Several similar methods of analysis have already been developed in the pursuit of making graphics that appear hand drawn.(Li Zhi-hui et al. 2012) (Ruilin Lin 2011) The composition can be judged by the density of graphite throughout zones of the drawing, this way, areas of the drawing can be identified as sparse or busy. Line quality could also be quantified by comparing the relative thickness and uniformity of the lines in the test to the set of drawings used for training. The shapes in the drawing are the 2-D projections of the 3-D subjects, so the outline of the test drawing can be measured against the training set. The degree to which the artist’s angles, whether sharper or softer than the test set, will be indicated. Assessing these core elements of a drawing would be one way for an artist to quantify improvement. One way for an artist to use this tool would be to improve their representations of real subjects. For example, photos of apples could be used to train the tool. Then the tool would output an evaluation of how “apple-like” the user’s drawing was based on the criteria mentioned earlier. Another way to use the tool is to try to deviate from established rules or norms. Someone focusing on a fantastic or surrealist work may be interested in moving their drawings away from realistic representations. This tool would provide them a way to judge which parts of their work deviates from the test set and the magnitude of the differences. Perhaps the artist notices that their hectic line work sets them apart from the images they used to train the tool, which leads them to experiment further. 2.3 Building Artistic Skills The tool is meant to help artists explore methods to improve their work without compromising the creative process. Like any tool, it needs to used correctly. The AAE will never replace an artist’s vision, creativity, or judgement, but instead provides the artist with a way to track their progress and find their style. To meet this end, AAE would be implemented with “artist in the loop” design, where the user can interact to influence the performance. An artist will be able to set and adjust a personal stylistic baseline (comprised of the elements mentioned earlier) so their progress is judged against their personal ideal. The tool is limited by the quality and quantity of training drawings. Therefore, the tool is not well suited to judging an entirely unique or new piece because of the lack of material for comparison. In some cases individual elements of drawing can be judged and the results of multiple analyses can be synthesized for a cumulative result. Using AAE allows an artist to get rapid personalized feedback on the core elements of their piece while maintaining creative control. The artist then interprets the feedback and innovates further so that the tool supplements the creative process rather than supplanting it. A beginner learning to draw could discover that they need to spend more time practicing fundamentals, while an experienced artist could get a better understanding of what makes their work unique by building a baseline.
