	abstract = {Alarm Management has become an ever-increasing topic of discussion in the power and processing
industries. In 2003, ISA started developing a standard around this subject. After six years of hard work, the
ANSI/ISA-18.2-2009 Management of Alarm Systems for the Process Industries standard was published.
This paper reviews the scope, regulatory impact, requirements, recommendations, alarm definitions, and
other details of the standard.},
