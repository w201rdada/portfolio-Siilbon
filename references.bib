	abstract = {This study aimed to perform art creation for picture books using hand-drawing skills combining computer graphing technology. The beginning of this study illustrated the characteristics of the mixed media used as paints. Case study was applied so that, through the discussion teaching method, the students could interact with the teacher to determine the themes of picture books, the contents, and the storyboards, and further come up with their art creations for picture books. Then, the students were guided to use the computer graphing software to process the images, arrange layouts, design front and back covers and inside pages, to complete art creation using of hand-drawing skills combining computer graphing technology.},

	abstract = {The existing technique of computer Non-Photorealistic Rendering ( NPR) on sketch drawing always has some differences from hand-drawing. In order to solve the problem, a method was designed which can generate sketch levels, and integrate with multi-pixel-wide lines to generate sketches which has sketch texture with sense of hierarchy. First, Pretreat the original image by denoising and enhancement, adopt differentiation to extract multi-pixel-wide contour lines, use dilation and erosion and subtract the result to generate multi-layer bilateral of contour lines, then take the processing of motion-blur to multi-layer bilateral of contour lines to generate sketch texture, and finally, integrate edge and sketch texture, thus completing images sketching. Through lots of experiments on images of different features, it is proved that the results of the method are more close to hand-drawing style.},

industries. In 2003, ISA started developing a standard around this subject. After six years of hard work, the
ANSI/ISA-18.2-2009 Management of Alarm Systems for the Process Industries standard was published.
This paper reviews the scope, regulatory impact, requirements, recommendations, alarm definitions, and
other details of the standard.},
