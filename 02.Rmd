## The Creative Struggle

One of the most fundamental mediums for artistic expression is pencil drawing.  It doesn't require expensive materials or space and it can be used used to plan works, or create original beautiful works.  Drawing takes a lot of practice and it can be stressful to ask the opinion of others during the early stages of a work.

## Using the Objectivity of a Machine

To help aleviate some of the stress of this process, a machine learning algorithm can be trained to recognize elements of other images and "score" the user artist's drawing against them.  For example, the algorithm could take a group of images of humans and judge the drawing's body proportions, maybe the forearms are too long, or the torso too short.    

## Building Skills Rapidly

This allows an artist to get rapid objective feedback on certain aspects of their work without judgement from their peers.
